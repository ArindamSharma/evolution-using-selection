# Explanation of Steps

# crossover

here i will follow 2 approach 
* genewise crossover 
    
    gene wise will swap /exchange the gene of parent to produce offspring
    here gene consist of 8 hexadecimal characters

* bitwise crossover
    
    bit wise will swap/exchange the bit of parent to produce offspring
    here 1 bit is nothing but 1 hexadeciaml character

there are different approach to crossover 

* Random 
    
    here considering random selector from parents for current index of offspring and generate offspring 

* N Point
    
    here considering N random location from where alternate exchange will happend to create offspring

Note : *In any of the above case there will always be 2 offspring generate ,for the code will will only consider first offspring*
